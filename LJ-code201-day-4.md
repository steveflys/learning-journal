1/10/17, Day 4
I was very tired because of the lack of sleep and the start of withdrawal from my BUTRANS script.  I will have to put up with the withdrawal until my new script arrives in late Jan.
On a more positive note I didn’t lose too much from the lecture because I didn’t once try to code along!!  My note taking was poor so I had to watch almost the entire lecture recording again to take notes.  Note to Allie:  Can you restate the questions asked so your answer makes more sense?  I can’t hear the student’s voices on the recording.
The lab time went well and it was a good learning experience to see others code and “get into their coding minds”.  Tyler is organized and has some very good work habits. He came up with a very good process for the project to ensure no mistakes were made.  I liked the comments on his code and how he formatted his console.log comments. Forrest’s code was good as well, but he needed to be reminded to follow the process so no mistakes were made.  Once he got into the swing of the exercise, he didn’t deviate from the process and things got faster.  This was a very good exercise and I look forward to working with more of my fellow “coders-in-training”.  I think we all learnt from each other.
The lab was done quickly and I had time to revisit the CSS failure from Day 3.  I started by trying many of the same things from the night before and tried to get it running in CodePen.  After 30 minutes (15 minutes TOO long!) I asked Michael S. for help.  Good move.  I haven’t worked with him much, but he has a very different way of looking at things.  He pointed out all the errors in my HTML code right away and showed me some new tricks in order to work on CSS from the browser.  One of the most important and lightbulb lighting moments was when he showed me how to give same object types a class in order to control them separately in the CSS.  This made it finally dawn on me that each object is a box of it’s own on the page and can be totally controlled by itself in CSS without effecting other similar objects. I had far too many <section>s in order to put all my lists in separate boxes when all I needed to do was give each list a class if I wanted to control it differently.  During my attempts to get the CSS to work I totally screwed up the HTML.  Lots of missing code and very poor formatting.  Once I got that straightened out, in less than 30 minutes, things progressed smoothly. It’s obvious each of the TAs has had to scale their own and different road blocking obstacle so they will all approach a problem from a different direction based on that experience. Michael was great, if a bit cold at first, and this was another big initial breakthrough for me to understand how this all fits together.
Carry over to-do list:
Letter is order for that day’s list and # is the class day created.
B-2. Spend more time playing with my own coding projects away from class and after my assignments are done instead of going down those rabbit holes while working on an assignment. 
Completed for the first time.  Needs to stay for at least a week to ensure it stays complete. 1 of 5
D-2. Stop making excuses for my loss of dexterity (sp?) and practice, practice, practice. 
I did this entire journal with the proper 2 handed and not the hunt-and-peck keyboard style.  Took a lot longer, but it will improve.  At one time I could type 60 wpm or more without ever looking at the keyboard.  This will stay until I can get thru this journal without looking at the keys and minimal mistakes.
E-2. Find time for the gym and workouts! I will lose so much so fast if I don't work on my fitness first. 
I went to the gym as soon as I got home today!!! This will also stay until I go to the gym at least 3 times a week and move the gyrotonics equipment into the office and use it daily.
F-2. Copy these must do's into the next day's journal and report on the progress of each as I add more. 
Done, but this stays until it is completed 5 days in a row. 2 of 5.
A-3. Start the time at home reading this journal and starting on that day’s journal when I do my Back In Control journal.
Done!  Again this needs to stay until I have 5 straight days of this.  1 of 5.
B-3. Start my time at home with the reading assignment.  Do not try to memorize, just read for basic knowledge and understanding of the book’s structure for later reference.
Done.  A lot of catching up to do on this. Again this needs to stay until I have 5 straight days of this.  1 of 5
C-3. Do not work past midnight.  You need your rest. Set alarm for 11:00pm as a reminder to start journal if I’m still working.
No need.  Its 10:30 and time for Koko time!
