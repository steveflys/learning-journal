1/10/17, Day 3 – (on the morning of day 4, too LATE to submit)
Well the Javascript was a little challenging in the lab at first and I felt I was getting too much help from Allie.  It finally clicked and I was able to breeze thru that portion of the lab quickly.  I really thought I understood the CSS box stuff and how to get the style looking right so I left at 6:00 pm thinking I needed to get home, eat, spend time with my wife, then finish the style.css to get the about-me looking the way I wanted.  I was totally wrong.  For some reason when I tried to write the code, particularly for the appearance on the <ol>, it just didn’t work.  I read and reread the book. Tried the examples from the book in my css, and nothing was working.  I spent 2-3 hours between the book and different websites trying to figure it out.  I reformatted my HTML structure many times with sections inside sections and <ol> inside <ul>, made borders to see what was changing when I changed the margins in case the numbers were off the screen.  At midnight I threw in the towel. I can turn it in as is and resubmit once I get straightened out by one of the TAs.  Went to do my reading in a comfortable chair and awoke at 3 am.  Don’t know when I fell asleep, but I didn’t remember anything I read.
Lesson Learned:
FOLLOW Allie’s advice and if you don’t get it in 15 minutes, get help.  If none is available wait until it is.  All I did was dig a deeper hole and by the time I turned it in I think the HTML was in bad shape and the CSS was shit. I didn’t really get anything out of the reading.  Not only did I probably screw up good code trying to chase the “problem”, but I screwed up the other assignment and didn’t get any worthwhile rest.
Carry over to-do list:
Letter is order for that day’s list and # is the class day created.
A-2. Stop trying to enter the teaching code into my Visual Studio and pay COMPLETE attention to Allie. 
Done.  I didn’t try to code along and I felt I got a lot more out of the lectures.
B-2. Spend more time playing with my own coding projects away from class and after my assignments are done instead of going down those rabbit holes while working on an assignment. 
FAILED! See above.  See new to-do at the end. 
C-2. STOP being so embarrassed to ask for help on even the simplest concept. I will never learn unless I ask for help when needed. 
Done.  See added to-do at end for follow on.
D-2. Stop making excuses for my loss of dexterity (sp?) and practice, practice, practice. 
Not done.  I never got to keyboard practice because of my partial failure on #3.
E-2. Find time for the gym and workouts! I will lose so much so fast if I don't work on my fitness first. 
Partial complete.  Moved the rower into the office to row for at least 30 minutes before I can work at home.  I still need to schedule actual gym time.
F-2. Copy these must do's into the next day's journal and report on the progress of each as I add more. 
Done, but this stays until it is completed 5 days in a row.
G-2. Organize and maintain the bookmarks in the Coding folder.
Done
A-3. Start the time at home reading this journal and starting on that day’s journal when I do my Back In Control journal.
B-3. Start my time at home with the reading assignment.  Do not try to memorize, just read for basic knowledge and understanding of the book’s structure for later reference.
C-3. Do not work past midnight.  You need your rest. Set alarm for 11:00pm as a reminder to start journal if I’m still working.
