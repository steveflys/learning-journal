Oh well, the first of many hammers fell today.  Just 2 days in.  I had a lot of strugles with keeping up during the lectures.  My use of keyboards really sucks! Especially this small laptop keyboard.  As I was trying to update my copy of the code in Visual Studio, I wasn't paying attention to the instructor and by the time I got my attention back to her, she was 2-3 steps beyond where I last paid attention. All this will get better as I do it more, so for now, NO MORE trying to enter her teaching code into my Visual Studio while she is pushing forward at such a rapid pace. 

I've also become addicted to 2 VERY large monitors where I can have open and see similtanuesly many different windows at the same time.  Gotta get small again!! 

On a positive note I am begining to absorb the "coder language" and many terms that were confusing me. My understanding of the syntax really fell into place today toward the end of the project at about 9:00pm.

Must Do's
    - Stop trying to enter the teaching code into my Visual Studio and pay COMPLETE attention to Allie.
    - Spend more time playing with my own coding projects away from class and after my assignments are done instead of going down those rabit holes while working on an assignment.
    - STOP being so embassased to ask for help on even the simplist concept.  I will never learn unless I ask for help when needed.
    - Stop making excuses for my loss of dexterity (sp?) and practice, practice, practice.
    - Find time for the gym and workouts! I will lose so much so fast if I don't work on my fitness first.
    - Copy these must do's into the next day's journal and report on the progress of each as I add more.  NOTHING should stay here longer than 1 week!
    - CSS, CSS, CSS.  read the chapters again and look for more learning sites on-line.
    - Organize and maintain the bookmarks in the Coding folder.

Do this journal in word and cut and paste it here.
